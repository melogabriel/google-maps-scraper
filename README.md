## Parameters

- Extracts many data points from google maps
- Exports the data to CSV, JSON or PostgreSQL 
- Performance about 120 urls per minute (-depth 1 -c 8)
- Extendable to write your own exporter
- Dockerized for easy run in multiple platforms
- Scalable in multiple machines
- Optionally extracts emails from the website of the business
- SOCKS5/HTTP/HTTPS proxy support
- Serverless execution via AWS Lambda functions (experimental & no documentation yet)
- Fast Mode (BETA)

## Notes on email extraction

By default email extraction is disabled. 

If you enable email extraction (see quickstart) then the scraper will visit the 
website of the business (if exists) and it will try to extract the emails from the
page.

For the moment it only checks only one page of the website (the one that is registered in Gmaps). At some point, it will be added support to try to extract from other pages like about, contact, impressum etc. 


Keep in mind that enabling email extraction results to larger processing time, since more
pages are scraped. 

## Fast Mode

Fast mode returns you at most 21 search results per query ordered by distance from the **latitude** and **longitude** provided.
All the results are within the specified **radius**

It does not contain all the data points but basic ones. 
However it provides the ability to extract data really fast. 

When you use the fast mode ensure that you have provided:
- zoom
- radius (in meters)
- latitude
- longitude


**Fast mode is Beta, you may experience blocking**
